This is Lua 1.0. It was never publicly released. This code is a snapshot of
the status of Lua on 28 Jul 1993. It is distributed for historical curiosity
to celebrate 10 years of Lua and is hereby placed in the public domain.

There is no documentation, except the test programs. The manual for Lua 1.1
probably works for this version as well.

The source files for the lexer and parser have been lost: all that is left is
the output of lex and yacc. A grammar can be found inside y_tab.c in yyreds.

The code compiles and runs in RedHat 5.2 with gcc 2.7.2.3. It may not run in
newer systems, because it assumes that stdin and stdout are constants, though
ANSI C does not promise they are. If make fails, try using the fixed modules
provided in the "fixed" directory. To see the differences (which are really
quite minor), do "make diff".

To see Lua 1.0 in action, do "make test". (The last test raises an error on
purpose.)

Enjoy!

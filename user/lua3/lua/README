This client is a sample lua interpreter.
It can be used as a batch interpreter and also interactively.

Here are the options it understands:

  -v       print version information
  -d       turn debug on
  -e stat  dostring `stat'
  -q       interactive mode without prompt
  -i       interactive mode with prompt
  -        executes stdin as a file
  a=b      sets global `a' with string `b' (no need to quote b)
  name     dofile `name'

If no options are given, then it reads lines from stdin and executes them
as they are read.  So, each line must contain a complete statement.
To span a statement across several lines, end each line with a backslash '\'.

To change the prompt, set the global variable _PROMPT to whatever you want.
You can do after calling the interpreter or on the command line with
	_PROMPT="lua: "
for example.

You must be careful when using quotes on the command line because they are
usually handled by the shell.

This interpreter is good for using Lua as a standalone language.
For a minimal interpreter, see etc/min.c.

If your application simply exports new functions to Lua (which is common),
then you can use this interpreter unmodified: just define a function

	void lua_userinit (void)

in your code. In this function, you should do whatever initializations are
need, typically exporting your functions to Lua.
If you use this scheme, you must explicily open any standard libraries you need.
See ../lib/linit.c
